# ads

Filterlist of domains listed in various `ads.txt` files.

Some are explicitly added and some are explicitly whitelisted.

## Usage

Just add this URL to your content blocker:

```
https://github.com/charles25565/ads/releases/download/continuous/filterlist.txt
```

Tested with uBlock Origin. 

> [!NOTE]
> It uses bare domains with wildcards rather than AdBlock Plus syntax.
