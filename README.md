Filterlist of domains listed in various "ads.txt" files. uBlock Origin is able to understand these.

Some are explicitly added and some are explicitly whitelisted.

## Usage

Just add `https://github.com/charles8191/ads/releases/download/continuous/filterlist.txt` to your adblocker! Tested with uBlock Origin. Note that it uses bare domains with wildcards rather than AdBlock Plus syntax.
